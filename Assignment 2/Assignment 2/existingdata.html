<h2 id = "accessingExistingData">Accessing Existing Data</h2>

<p>The system must achieve a critical usefulness early on. Existing hypertext
systems have had to justify themselves solely on new data. If, however, there
was an existing base of data of personnel, for example, to which new data
could be linked, the value of each new piece of data would be greater.</p>

<p>What is required is a gateway program which will map an existing structure
onto the hypertext model, and allow limited (perhaps read-only) access to it.
This takes the form of a hypertext server written to provide existing
information in a form matching the standard interface. One would not imagine
the server actually generating a hypertext database from and existing one:
rather, it would generate a hypertext view of an existing database.</p>

<p>Some examples of systems which could be connected in this way are</p>
<dl>
  <dt>uucp News</dt>
    <dd>This is a Unix electronic conferencing system. A server for uucp news
      could makes links between notes on the same subject, as well as showing
      the structure of the conferences.</dd>
  <dt>VAX/Notes</dt>
    <dd>This is Digital's electronic conferencing system. It has a fairly wide
      following in FermiLab, but much less in CERN. The topology of a
      conference is quite restricting.</dd>
  <dt>CERNDOC</dt>
    <dd>This is a document registration and distribution system running on
      CERN's VM machine. As well as documents, categories and projects,
      keywords and authors lend themselves to representation as hypertext
      nodes.</dd>
  <dt>File systems</dt>
    <dd>This would allow any file to be linked to from other hypertext
      documents.</dd>
  <dt>The Telephone Book</dt>
    <dd>Even this could even be viewed as hypertext, with links between people
      and sections, sections and groups, people and floors of buildings,
    etc.</dd>
  <dt>The unix manual</dt>
    <dd>This is a large body of computer-readable text, currently organised in
      a flat way, but which also contains link information in a standard
      format ("See also..").</dd>
  <dt>Databases</dt>
    <dd>A generic tool could perhaps be made to allow any database which uses
      a commercial DBMS to be displayed as a hypertext view.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In some cases, writing these servers would mean unscrambling or obtaining
details of the existing protocols and/or file formats. It may not be practical
to provide the full functionality of the original system through hypertext. In
general, it will be more important to allow read access to the general public:
it may be that there is a limited number of people who are providing the
information, and that they are content to use the existing facilities.</p>

<p>It is sometimes possible to enhance an existing storage system by coding
hypertext information in, if one knows that a server will be generating a
hypertext representation. In 'news' articles, for example, one could use (in
the text) a standard format for a reference to another article. This would be
picked out by the hypertext gateway and used to generate a link to that note.
This sort of enhancement will allow greater integration between old and new
systems.</p>

<p>There will always be a large number of information management systems - we
get a lot of added usefulness from being able to cross-link them. However, we
will lose out if we try to constrain them, as we will exclude systems and
hamper the evolution of hypertext in general.</p>
