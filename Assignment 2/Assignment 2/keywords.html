<h2 id = "keyWords">The problem with keywords</h2>

<p>Keywords are a common method of accessing data for which one does not have
the exact coordinates. The usual problem with keywords, however, is that two
people never chose the same keywords. The keywords then become useful only to
people who already know the application well.</p>

<p>Practical keyword systems (such as that of VAX/NOTES for example) require
keywords to be registered. This is already a step in the right direction. A
linked system takes this to the next logical step. Keywords can be nodes which
stand for a concept. A keyword node is then no different from any other node.
One can link documents, etc., to keywords. One can then find keywords by
finding any node to which they are related. In this way, documents on similar
topics are indirectly linked, through their key concepts. A keyword search
then becomes a search starting from a small number of named nodes, and finding
nodes which are close to all of them.</p>

<p>It was for these reasons that I first made a small linked information
system, not realising that a term had already been coined for the idea:
"hypertext".</p>
