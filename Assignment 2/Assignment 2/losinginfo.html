<h2 id = "losingInfo">Losing Information at CERN</h2>

<p>CERN is a wonderful organisation. It involves several thousand people, many
of them very creative, all working toward common goals. Although they are
nominally organised into a hierarchical management structure,this does not
constrain the way people will communicate, and share information, equipment
and software across groups.</p>

<p>The actual observed working structure of the organisation is a multiply
connected "web" whose interconnections evolve with time. In this environment,
a new person arriving, or someone taking on a new task, is normally given a
few hints as to who would be useful people to talk to. Information about what
facilities exist and how to find out about them travels in the corridor gossip
and occasional newsletters, and the details about what is required to be done
spread in a similar way. All things considered, the result is remarkably
successful, despite occasional misunderstandings and duplicated effort.</p>

<p>A problem, however, is the high turnover of people. When two years is a
typical length of stay, information is constantly being lost. The introduction
of the new people demands a fair amount of their time and that of others
before they have any idea of what goes on. The technical details of past
projects are sometimes lost forever, or only recovered after a detective
investigation in an emergency. Often, the information has been recorded, it
just cannot be found.</p>

<p>If a CERN experiment were a static once-only development, all the
information could be written in a big book. As it is, CERN is constantly
changing as new ideas are produced, as new technology becomes available, and
in order to get around unforeseen technical problems. When a change is
necessary, it normally affects only a small part of the organisation. A local
reason arises for changing a part of the experiment or detector. At this
point, one has to dig around to find out what other parts and people will be
affected. Keeping a book up to date becomes impractical, and the structure of
the book needs to be constantly revised.</p>

<p>The sort of information we are discussing answers, for example, questions like</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where is this module used?</li>
  <li>Who wrote this code? Where does he work?</li>
  <li>What documents exist about that concept?</li>
  <li>Which laboratories are included in that project?</li>
  <li>Which systems depend on this device?</li>
  <li>What documents refer to this one?</li>
</ul>

<p>The problems of information loss may be particularly acute at CERN, but in
this case (as in certain others), CERN is a model in miniature of the rest of
world in a few years time. CERN meets now some problems which the rest of the
world will have to face soon. In 10 years, there may be many commercial
solutions to the problems above, while today we need something to allow us to
continue.</p>
